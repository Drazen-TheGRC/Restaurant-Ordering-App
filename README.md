This project was a task on one of many modules on Scrimba. The app needs to have at least 3 food products which can be added/removed to/from cart. The total price needs to be calculated using JS and user can complete order where the user will be prompted with a form to fill after which submition user will be prompted with a message that the order was successful. I decided to to add some extra stretch goals for myself and added another drink menu, few extra buttons so the product quantity can be added and subtracted etc. Instead of using images for products I used emojis and it worked fine on my Android phone and on Windows 11. I was given a warning that there might be an issue with emojis on different devices so i will test the project and fix posible issues.
